### Dynamic Programming
* We can choose between options
* We will be asked to find optimal solutions (max, min, longest, shortest, etc)
* We use recursion with storage(memoization) to solve dynamic programming.
* Recursive function should call itself with smaller inputs.
* We can also use tabular form instead of storage(memoization) after recursion.
